Revision history for XPAN-Query

0.05     2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - No functional changes.

         - Move examples from manual scripts in App-XPANQueryUtils to Rinci
           function metadata, for later when that dist is rebuilt using an
           updated DZP::Rinci::ScriptFromFunc.


0.04    2014-06-06 (SHARYANTO)

        - [Incompatible change] Change return type for some function, now all
          function return array (table data) instead of hash.

        - Add argument: detail (false by default). Return names/ID's by default
          instead of detailed records.

        - Add filters by author, dist.

        - Split CLI scripts to App-XPANQueryUtils to make dependencies of this
          distribution lighter.
