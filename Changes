Revision history for XPAN-Query

0.07    2014-12-14 (PERLANCAR)

	- [ux] By default query should search for substring too, like the
	  old version.


0.06     2014-12-14 (PERLANCAR)

         - Introduce $URL & $CACHE_PERIOD, can also be preset from XPAN_URL and
           XPAN_CACHE_PERIOD environment variables.

         - By default looks at /cpan *or* http://www.cpan.org/, so the 'url'
           argument is now optional (and now can be set from environment
           anyway).

         - Instead of Sereal, now converts 02packages.details.txt.gz to SQLite
           database. This makes first-time conversion longer (1-2s to 10-15s on
           my computer) but makes subsequent queries faster (from +- 0.3-0.5s to
           only millisecs) and makes this module usable for tab completion.

         - No longer depends on Unix external command 'zcat', but now uses
           PerlIO::gzip.


0.05     2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - No functional changes.

         - Move examples from manual scripts in App-XPANQueryUtils to Rinci
           function metadata, for later when that dist is rebuilt using an
           updated DZP::Rinci::ScriptFromFunc.


0.04    2014-06-06 (SHARYANTO)

        - [Incompatible change] Change return type for some function, now all
          function return array (table data) instead of hash.

        - Add argument: detail (false by default). Return names/ID's by default
          instead of detailed records.

        - Add filters by author, dist.

        - Split CLI scripts to App-XPANQueryUtils to make dependencies of this
          distribution lighter.


0.03    2014-06-05 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add --query.

        - Some fixes.
